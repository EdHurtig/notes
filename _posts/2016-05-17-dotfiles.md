# DotFiles

Dotfiles are slang for "hidden" files in *NIX systems.  They acuired this name because, in order to make a 
file hidden in most *NIX systems, you just put a `.` in front of the filename.  You will likely find at least
a few of these files in your home directory.

Hidden files are hidden by default, and thus they won't be visible in Finder or whatever File manager you use.
Most file managers have a setting to "show hidden files" that you can toggle on and off

To list hidden files on the command line (Terminal), use the `-a` argument for the `ls` command (`ls -a`)

## Examples

I have a ton of my (public) dotfiles in a github repo, which was forked from @jeffbyrnes back when I worked at [Evertrue](http://evertrue.com)
